**Point agent-fox at a spec. Walk away. Come back to working code across 50+
commits.**

agent-fox is an autonomous coding-agent orchestrator. It reads your
specifications, builds a dependency graph of tasks, and drives 
Claude coding agents through each one.

## Before agent-fox

You write a spec, then sit in front of your terminal babysitting an AI agent
for hours. You paste context, fix merge conflicts, restart after crashes, and
lose track of what's done. 

By session 10 you're exhausted and the agent has forgotten everything from session 1.

## With agent-fox

You write the same spec, run `agent-fox code`, and go do something else.

The fox reads your specs, plans the work, spins up isolated worktrees, runs each
session with the right context, handles merge conflicts, retries failures,
extracts learnings into structured memory, and merges clean commits to
`develop`. 

You come back to a finished feature branch and a standup report.

## Quick start

```bash
# Initialize your project
agent-fox init

# Create the task graph
agent-fox plan 

# Run autonomous coding sessions with 4 agents in parallel
agent-fox code --parallel 4

# Check progress
agent-fox status
```

Your project needs specs under `.specs/` before running `plan` or `code`.

Use the `/af-spec` skill in Claude Code to generate them from a PRD,
a GitHub issue or a plain-English description:

```
/af-spec [path-to-prd-or-prompt-or-github-issue-url]
```

agent-fox ships with a set of [Claude Code skills](docs/skills.md) that assist
with spec authoring, architecture decisions, code simplification, and more.

See the [CLI reference](docs/cli-reference.md) for all command options.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --group dev
make test              # all tests
make lint              # check lint + formatting
make check             # lint + all tests
```
